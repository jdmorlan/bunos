When we started the iHaul project we knew that there were going to be a lot of systems that iHaul needed, but that didn't have to necessarily be directly tied to `iHaul`. We initially started with a cloud functions to split out functionality, but ultimately ended up with a monorepo that had a lot of express applications. The `Bunos` project is us pulling out all those components that don't and shouldn't belong to `iHaul` and making them available to the entire EOG Resources developer community.

The philosphy is that as things are built in `iHaul` and become stable, we can pull things out into `bunos` so that if others want to use them they can.

As of today, we have the following systems that are made up of separate packages. Each system has a section in the `docs`. So, if you're interested in any of them check out the docs to see how you can get started

## Gateway

We have utilized a structure where we build smaller web-applications, but host them through a gateway as if they were all one large application.

## Web Socket

A web socket server that clients can connect to and systems can publish to

## Attribute Based Access Control

Instead of using `roles`, you can utilize the context of a user and the resource they are wanting to perform an action against to determine if they have the proper permissions
